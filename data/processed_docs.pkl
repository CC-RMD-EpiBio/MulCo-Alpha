p1022
sV27
p1023
VThe increase reflected the strength of the housing industry , which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather .

VWASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January , the government reported on Friday , evidence that America 's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia .
p1040
sV3
p1041
VWith growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force , the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month , just a notch above its quarter-century low .
p1042

VIt was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong .

p1045
VAverage hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents , to $ 12.51 .
p1046
sV4
p1047
VThe demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month .
p1048
sV7
p1049
VBut economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation .
p1050
sV6
p1051
VThe gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier , extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade .
p1052
sV9
p1053
VStocks rose , pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points , to 8,189.49 , leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6 .
p1054
sV8
p1055
VAnd because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States , investors disregarded the large jobs gains , betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming .
p1056
sV38
p1057
VAmong high school graduates , the rate was 3.9 percent , and college graduates , 1.9 percent .
p1058
sV11
p1059
V`` Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability , '' said Paul McCulley , an economist at UBS Securities .
p1060
sV10
p1061
VIn the bond market , a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety , prices edged up , pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent .
p1062
sV13
p1063
VWith potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines , the Fed and its chairman , Alan Greenspan , have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another .
p1064
sV12
p1065
V`` The bottom line is that we 've got a lovely economy . ''
p1066
sV15
p1067
VAfter accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December 's figures , the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997 .
p1068
sV14
p1069
VThe job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall , just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling .
p1070
sV17
p1071
VInflation has been almost nonexistent , and consumer confidence has been extremely strong .
p1072
sV16
p1073
VThe surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces .
p1074
sV19
p1075
VLong-term interest rates , an important indicator of economic stability , have fallen in the last few months .
p1076
sV18
p1077
VAfter a short , sharp drop when Asia 's financial problems first became clear , the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy .
p1078
sV31
p1079
V`` The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock , '' McCulley said .
p1080
sV30
p1081
VAnd the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports .
p1082
sV37
p1083
VAmong people with less than a high school education , the rate in January was 7.2 percent .
p1084
sV36
p1085
VThe analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education .
p1086
sV35
p1087
VFor the first time , the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender , age and race .
p1088
sV34
p1089
VThe rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent , to 4.4 percent .
p1090
sV33

VToday , hundreds of people from the US began to arrive , including some Cuban Americans who left here when Castro came to power and are returning to Havana for the first time .
p3347

VAnd so , people are increasingly enthusiastic by today , Cuban television , which clings to the Communist Party line , actually began to promote its papal coverage .

VHis men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks by Hun Sen 's troops .
p3559

p3560
VThey have been aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng , who have formed an alliance with Ranariddh 's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.
p3561
sV20
p3562
VBut in June last year , the remaining leadership had a falling out , and Pol Pot was arrested .
p3563
sV21
p3564
VIn July last year in Phnom Penh , Cambodia 's capital , Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh .
p3565
sV22
p3566
VRanariddh 's loyalists , including Nhek Bunchhay , his top military commander , went into hiding or fled the capital .
p3567
sV23

VNhek Bunchhay , evading an intensive manhunt , made his way to O'Smach , the last major outpost held by Ranariddh 's forces .
p3569

p3570
VGen. Nhek Bunchhay , a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh , said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks .
p3571
sV0
p3572
VO'SMACH , Cambodia -LRB- AP -RRB- _ The top commander of a Cambodian resistance force said Thursday he has sent a team to recover the remains of a British mine removal expert kidnapped and presumed killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas almost two years ago .
p3573
sV3
p3574
VThere were many conflicting accounts of his fate .
p3575
sV2
p3576
VHowes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996 .
p3577
sV5
p3578
VIn January this year , British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured .
p3579
sV4
p3580
VHowes ' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from Angkor Wat , the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia 's main tourist attraction , when it was attacked .
p3581
sV7
p3582
V`` Obviously , it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months , but there is no proof of life .
p3583
sV6
p3584
VThe Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes , 37 years old when he was kidnapped , that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26 , 1996 .
p3585
sV9
p3586
V`` We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened . ''
p3587
sV8
p3588
VBut there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death , '' said a Foreign Office spokesman , speaking with customary anonymity .
p3589
sV11
p3590
VNhek Bunchhay , who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d'etat last year , appeared confident he would find Howes ' remains .
p3591
sV10
p3592
VThai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain , through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia , has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears .
p3593
sV13
p3594
VIf and when the remains are found , he said , they would be turned over to the British Embassy , apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok .
p3595
sV12
p3596
VHe said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried , and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search .
p3597
sV15
p3598
VPol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s .
p3599
sV14
p3600
VNhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot , then the guerrilla group 's leader .
p3601
sV17
p3602
VBut the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders , Ieng Sary .
p3603
sV16
p3604
VAt the time Howes was captured , the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms .
p3605
sV19
p3606
VA small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border .
p3607

V`` The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous , '' she said .

VNEWARK , N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began delving Thursday into the slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area , as law-enforcement officials acknowledged that they needed to work harder to solve the cases of murdered women .
p4028
sV3
p4029
VCiting an example , Sgt. Derek Glenn , a spokesman for the Newark Police Department , said that of nine women who had been killed last year , suspects had been arrested in only four cases .
p4030
sV2
p4031
VState , county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases .
p4032
sV5
p4033
VEight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department , Glenn said .
p4034
sV4
p4035
VBut over all , arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases , he said .
p4036
sV7
p4037
VBut with the task-force investigation just getting under way , officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions , leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases .
p4038
sV6
p4039
VOf the eight victims , three were stabbed , two were strangled , two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated , he said , and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related .
p4040
sV9
p4041
V`` I have n't seen a pattern yet , '' said Patricia Hurt , the Essex County prosecutor , who created the task force on Tuesday .
p4042
sV8
p4043
VThere have been no arrests in any of the slayings .
